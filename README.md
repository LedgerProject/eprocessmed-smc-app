* For the professional: It standardizes the information presented to the patient, fully and absolutely ensures the integrity of the Signed Consent, reduces document costs and process times.

## Built with

* [NodeJS 14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular 11](https://angular.io/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)

## The Technology

Using Express with NodeJS, ApiREST has been built that give access to the data to the FrontEnd that is built in AngularJS. Similarly, using NodeJS together with Web3.js, access points have been built to communicate the FrontEnd with the Alastria blockchain.

## Software used

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)


##  Directory structure 

 - In "smart-consent" is the new frontend structure 
 - In "api_df_middleware" is a business middle layer
 - In "api_df_back" contains the data models
 - In "apiblockchain" It contains an api that gives access 
   to the frontend to interact with the Alastria blockchain.
