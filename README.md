## SmartConsent Project

eHealth startup focused exclusively on the digitization of medical processes, has technologically advanced the medical informed consent in security and communication.
It helps the understanding of the patient and offers security using blockchain technology in each step of the informed consent.

* For the patient: Facilitates understanding and acceptance of the indicated procedure; reduces doubts, uncertainties and fears derived from ignorance.

* For the professional: It standardizes the information presented to the patient, fully and absolutely ensures the integrity of the Signed Consent, reduces document costs and process times.

## Built with

* [NodeJS 14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular 11](https://angular.io/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)

## The Technology

Using Express with NodeJS, ApiREST has been built that give access to the data to the FrontEnd that is built in AngularJS. Similarly, using NodeJS together with Web3.js, access points have been built to communicate the FrontEnd with the Alastria blockchain.

## Software used

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)


##  Directory structure 

 - In "smart-consent" is the new frontend structure 
 - In "api_df_middleware" is a business middle layer
 - In "api_df_back" contains the data models
 - In "apiblockchain" It contains an api that gives access 
   to the frontend to interact with the Alastria blockchain.


## Starting a development environment

### Prerequisites

* npm and node.js: first of all install npm and node.js (https://nodejs.org/it/download/)

* Angular CLI: install the Angular CLI (https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)


npm install

## Available scripts

To run each project:

To run api_df_middleware:
```sh
/api_df_middleware/src$ node app.js
```

To run api_df_back:
```sh
 /api_df_back/src$ node app.js
```

To run the rest api to access the blockchain:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run smart-consent FRONT:

ng serve
```


## How the front works


![](./smart-consent/src/assets/img/1.jpg)

Login screen, access to the system, with user and password

![](./smart-consent/src/assets/img/2.jpg)

Screen for the creation of consents, a list of registered patients is presented, the specialty of the doctor who accesses the system is selected, and the procedure with which the consent will be generated. When creating consent, a modal is shown with the data that will be sent to the block chain and be able to generate the hash of the record. In addition, it allows you to view the pdf with the consent generated.

It lists the consents generated by the specialist, it also shows a button that redirects to the Alastria registry that is generated when the consent is created.

Screen that lists the procedures loaded in the database, it also contains a Button that allows the creation of new procedures using a modal that allows the entry of information.

Screen that lists the patients loaded into the database, also contains a Button that allows the creation of new ones, using a modal that allows the entry of their respective data.
